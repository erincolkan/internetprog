				to be prophetic, he asks a Romani fortune teller in a nearby town about its meaning. The woman interprets <br>
				the dream as a prophecy telling the boy that he will discover a treasure at the Egyptian pyramids. Early into <br>
			    his journey, he meets an old king named Melchizedek or the king of Salem, who tells him to sell his sheep so as <br>
				to travel to Egypt and introduces the idea of a Personal Legend. Your Personal Legend "is what you have always <br>
				wanted to accomplish. Everyone, when they are young, knows what their Personal Legend is. Early in his arrival <br>
				to Africa a man who claims to be able to take Santiago to the pyramids instead robs him of what money he had  <br>
				made from selling his sheep. Santiago then embarks on a long path of working for a crystal merchant <br>
				so as to make enough money to fulfil his personal legend and go to the pyramids. Along the way, the <br>
				boy meets an Englishman who has come in search of an alchemist and continues his travels in his new <br>
				companion's company. When they reach an oasis, Santiago meets and falls in love with an Arabian girl <br>
				named Fatima, to whom he proposes marriage. She promises to do so only after he completes his journey. <br>
				Frustrated at first, he later learns that true love will not stop nor must one sacrifice to it one's <br>
				personal destiny, since to do so robs it of truth.The boy then encounters a wise alchemist who also teaches <br>
				him to realize his true self. Together they risk a journey through the territory of warring tribes, where <br>
				the boy is forced to demonstrate his oneness with "the soul of the world" by turning himself into a simoom <br>
				before he is allowed to proceed. When he begins digging within sight of the pyramids, he is robbed yet again <br>
				but learns accidentally from the leader of the thieves that the treasure he seeks was all the time in the <br>
				ruined church where he had his original dream.
