			<h2>V For Vendetta</h2>
			<p><i>
				V For Vendetta is a movie made in 2005 by DC Comics, starring Hugo Weaving <br>
				and Natalie Portman, directed by James McTeigue. The movie is basically about the <br>
				V and his dedication to his vengeance, or you can say goal. His goal is to get vengeance from <br>
				people whose responsible what he had suffer	in the past and give the people of England the freedom <br>
				they have been desperately seeking by taking down the tyrannical regime. The thing I like in this <br>
				movie, specifically, is the character of V. He is so kind, sophisticated and so dedicated <br>
				and those specifications of him makes you feel so many different and conflicting emotions during  <br>
				the movie.And the love of V and Evey is so pure that can make you believe in true love again. <br>

			<h2>Curious Case of Benjamin Button</h2>
			<p><i>
				Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a movie made in 2009, directed by David Fincher and <br>
				starring Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. The storyline is loosely based on the 1922 short story <br>
				of the same name by F. Scott Fitzgerald.Benjamin has a disease, he was aging the opposite of normal people. <br>
				His mother died when she was giving birth to him and his father abandoned him because of the anger of his wife's <br>
				death and the sadness when he saw Benjamin's old, ugly face. Where he abandoned him was a nursing home and the  <br>
				woman responsible from this place raised Benjamin. The lesson I learned and why I love this movie is because the  <br>
				"The Ugly Duckling" like story. You shouldn't judge people by their appereances and anybody who is a ugly duckling  <br>
				can turn into a gorgeous swan. This isn't just a basic ethical lesson, it's a very big and important metaphor if  <br>
				you can understand. And the second thing I like in this movie is the timeless, beautiful and unsparing love among  <br>
				Benjamin and Daisy. No matter where they go, no matter they have been through,no matter they were old or young <br>
				the fate and their love for each other always kept them connected. This is a kind of love that <br>
				everyone wants but only someone can have.

			<h2>Life is Beautiful</h2>
			<p><i>
				This movie is an Italian movie, directed by Italian director Roberto Bengini and also starring Roberto Bengini <br>
				and Nicoletta Braschi. The movie is considered as a cult by most movie enthusiasts and it's about the <br>
				holocaust to the Jewish people during the WWII, but the movie shows us a very unexpected side of this <br>
				embarrasing historical event. A man, Guido strangely coincides with a beautiful teacher Dora and they <br>
				fell in love each other more by each occuring coincide. Finally they marry (actually Guido kidnaps <br>
				Dora willingly from her wedding with an another wealthy man) each other and have a little child named <br>
				Giosue. The crimes against Jewish people was going on already but with the beginning of the WWII, they  <br>
				arrest all the Orefice family and sent them to a working camp. Giosue was too young to understand and be  <br>
				able to comprehend what is really going on, so his father Guido told him that it was a vacation that you  <br>
				can win a tank if you collect all the points and be the first one on the list. Guido dead while searching for   <br>
				Dora when war is over but both Dora and Giosue survived from the camp and Giosue magically had a chance to get  <br>
				in an actual tank. I must say that I laughed, cried, laughed and cried atthe same time while watching the movie <br>
				and I saw the cruel and worst side of the human history by watching this amazing movie.

			<h2>The Intouchables</h2>
			<p><i>
				I recommended this movie to everyone I was talking about movies and haven't watched it yet. This movie is <br>
				a French production, directed by Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano and it's based upon a real story. Starring <br>
				Fran√ßois Cluzet and Omar Sy. The movie is about a wealthy man quadriplegic from a paradigling accident and <br>
				his friendship that is unlikely close and funny. Driss is a poor and jobless man wants to get unemployment <br>
				benefit. But he has to apply some jobs and get rejected to get this benefit. So he goes to the home of Philippe <br>
				not knowingly and all he expected from them to was to sign a piece of paper that will show he was rejected from <br>
				this job. But Philippe liked the Driss and the thing he liked especially is, Driss wasn't pitying him and even <br>
				making jokes about his situation. As time goes, they became real buddies and have really fun together and you <br> 
				can join their fun by watching this beautiful movie. It'll worth your time, believe me!	<br>
